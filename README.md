# HPC17-Homework4
Homework4, MPI blocking and non-blocking, parallel sample sort.

## Compile
Type `make` in a terminal.

## Run MPI-parallel 2D Jacobi smoother
Enter `./jacobi-mpi2D N max_iters` and `./nonblocking N max_iters`,

where `N` is the total number of discretization points, `max_iters` is the maximum number of iterations.
