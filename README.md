# HPC17-Homework4
Homework4, MPI blocking and non-blocking, parallel sample sort.

## Compile the OpenMP version of Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel solvers
Type `make` in a terminal.

## Run the solvers
Enter `./jacobi2D-omp N max_iters` and `./gs2D-omp N max_iters`,

where `N` is the number of discretization points, `max_iters` is the maximum number of iterations.
